# Pet Vaccination Hub

## Project Overview
The **Pet Vaccination Management Project** is designed to efficiently manage vaccinations for pets, making it an ideal solution for veterinary clinics. The application offers an intuitive interface with three key areas of reference:

- **Animal Operations Management**
- **Vaccine Operations Management**
- **Vaccination Administration Management**

## Main Features
- **Data Management**: Users can manage data within tables according to their needs, with operations such as adding, deleting, and displaying records.
- **Vaccine Assignment**: Vaccines can be assigned to pets based on their ID, with the option to add the vaccination date.
- **Cascading Deletion**: Deleting a pet or a vaccine automatically removes all associated vaccination records from the database.
- **Auto Increment Reset**: If all records in a table are deleted, the auto-increment counter resets to 1.
- **User Feedback**: Each operation is accompanied by messages and displays that describe the current status of the request.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML & CSS
- **Backend**: PHP & MySQL
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Purpose
This project was developed to reinforce concepts related to MySQL database management and to create a web application with real-world applicability. Additionally, managing feedback messages for each operation has enhanced my attention to detail, requiring consideration of potential issues that a typical user might encounter.
